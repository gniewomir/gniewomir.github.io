* Link generated pdf version in website version

* Add favicon
* Add meta
* Put in Git/GitHub
* Automate deployment to either my DO or github.io
* Automate pdf rendering in Chromium based tool as wkhtmltopdf/webkit seems to produce subpar results
* Put it in the deployment pipeline
* Maybe turn it into a full-fledged dev cv creator?
  * explainer about my line of thinking when it comes to cv structure and content
  * explainer why photos, age, sex/gender etc. should be avoided in cv for principal reasons
  * explainer why baseline expectations should be stated
  * explainer why the proposed approach might work better for the "dark matter" developers of industry
  * explainer why I think that CV should tell a story
  * how to deal with aesthetic page brakes when generating pdf with arbitrary content in an automated way?
  * Optional projects/publications/appearances sections?
  * minimal and strictly limited theming ability so personalisation is possible, but without losing content-focus?
  * pdf not page footer on the bottom of the last page?
  * save/load to/from JSON?
  * "buy me a coffee" for satisfied users? :)

    <h1>Who am I as a professional</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Self-taught developer with around 12 years of commercial experience of which 9 are relevant; hobby interest as
        a kid
      </li>
      <li>Concerned with managing complexity at the project level as the first order of business</li>
      <li>I consider automated tests a requirement, not an afterthought—<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.04374.pdf"
                                                                           title="Code Red: The Business Impact of Code Quality
– A Quantitative Study of 39 Proprietary Production Codebases">development speed is a function of quality</a></li>
      <li>I consider static code analysis and code standard enforcement tools as a must, preferably applied from the
        start
      </li>
      <li>Focused on <abbr
        title="SOLID is an acronym for five main principles of Object-Oriented Programming: single responsibility principle, open-closed principle, Liskov substitution principle, interface segregation principle and dependency inversion principle">SOLID</abbr>,
        <abbr
          title="Understood as structured in such a way, that it can be easily tested in a maximum possible isolation from the whole system.">testable</abbr>,
        <abbr
          title="Understood as encapsulating and isolating complexity in clearly defined and small enough context to be reasoned about, so side effects of change are easily imaginable.">maintainable</abbr>
        code, and developer experience
      </li>
      <li>Fan of the <abbr title="Command Query Responsibility Segregation">CQRS</abbr>/<abbr
        title="Domain-driven design">DDD</abbr> combo in complex applications, as it enforces a clear application
        interface, promotes knowledge preservation, and enables the creation of easy-to-write, easy-to-read, and
        cheap-to-maintain tests, by allowing the readable, self-validating setup of application state before
        testing—making <abbr
          title="Understood as test-first no exceptions approach">canonical</abbr> <abbr
          title="Test-driven development">TDD</abbr> possible at scale
      </li>
      <li>Current stacks:
        <ul>
          <li>PHP with Symfony/Laravel/WordPress and vanilla flavor</li>
          <li>TypeScript with Node/NestJS/Express/React/Redux/GraphQL/REST/etc. and supporting toolchain</li>
          <li><abbr
            title="I haven't used this stack in day-to-day work for a long time, therefore I will need an additional month or so to become fully productive.">Rusty</abbr>
            Python with Django/DRF
          </li>
          <li>Open to switching from React to Angular, Vue</li>
          <li>Open to switching from PHP to Go, Java</li>
          <li>I'm open to learning other technologies, and I can be productive with most of them before the end of the
            grace period
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Not a DevOps, but I was setting up and maintaining CI pipelines for <abbr
        title="small to medium-sized business">SMB</abbr>, and used
        Docker, Terraform, Ansible, GitHub, GitLab, etc. to keep infrastructure in <abbr title="version control system">VCS</abbr>.
        Worked with Azure, DigitalOcean, and - in a limited capacity - AWS
      </li>
      <li>Not a database geek, but on friendly terms with PostgreSQL - I can act on <code>EXPLAIN ANALYZE</code> results
        or switch to another dialect with some help from the documentation. Still waiting for a good excuse to use a
        NoSQL database instead
      </li>
      <li>Happy to create a frontend as part of work on a full stack project or to set up its foundations for other
        developers to use - as I did many times before, but not interested in doing frontend full-time
      </li>
      <li>
        Typically, I will try to adhere strictly to standards already in place and learn, until I understand why things
        are done the way they are. Then, with a better understanding of stack and domain, I will look for ways to remove
        the bottlenecks for the team and my productivity
      </li>
    </ul>

  <section>
    <h1>Who am I as a person</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>I have strong opinions but loosely held. I'm aware that every decision will be a trade-off. I seek learning
        opportunities
      </li>
      <li>Clean-code aficionado; I work well in a team with open-minded & more pragmatic devs. We keep each other in
        check
      </li>
      <li>Very wide, although often shallow, knowledge of current trends, technologies, and tools used in the backend,
        frontend, and operations. I prefer keeping mental bookmarks and evaluating tools when a need arises instead of
        chasing hype
      </li>
      <li>Research skills and curiosity allow for fast adaptation to new methodologies, tools, and technologies, but I
        have no expert-level knowledge in any particular field. A consequence of being a full stack with a background in
        fast-paced Internet media
      </li>
      <li>No management ambitions, although I value independence and ownership. I assumed the role of informal <strong>tech</strong>
        lead a few times if it was required to move the project forward, but this is as far as I'm willing to go at the
        moment
      </li>
      <li>Able and eager to bring legacy projects up to current standards—if the company is committed to it already, but
        I'm tired of explaining exponential compound interest on Technical Debt. Bring me in to build or improve things,
        not for

          care</abbr>
      </li>
      <li>Poor interview skills, as I tend to focus on high-level concepts, not things I can and I do Google all the
        time. Haven’t trained for white-board algorithmic challenges. The best way of assessing my value for a potential
        employer is a recruitment task or an interview with a developer of similar or greater experience
      </li>
      <li>Used to and fond of working in international, diverse teams and English-only communication - both verbally and
        in writing
      </li>
      <li>Privately I love good reportage or sci-fi, vintage cocktail bars, and switching from one nerdy obsession to
        another. I have random bits of trivia and sometimes even an opinion about a random list of things from historic
        naval warfare to why Florence Welsh is the best modern singer. Do not try to argue with me about the last one,
        anything else is fair game

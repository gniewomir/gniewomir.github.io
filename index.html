    <h1>Who am I as a professional</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Known stacks:
        <ul>
          <li>TypeScript with Node/NestJS/Express/React/Redux/GraphQL/REST etc. and supporting toolchain</li>
          <li>PHP with Symfony/Laravel/WordPress and vanilla flavor</li>
          <li><abbr
            title="I haven't used this stack in day-to-day work for a long time, therefore I will need an additional month or so to become fully productive.">Rusty</abbr>
            Python with Django/DRF
          </li>
          <li>I'm open to learning other technologies
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>I believe that <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.04374.pdf" title="Code Red: The Business Impact of Code Quality – A Quantitative Study of 39 Proprietary Production Codebases">development speed is a function of quality</a> in any non-trivial code-base</li>
      <li>I consider automated tests the best form of documentation.</li>
      <li>I consider static code analysis and code standard enforcement tools as a must</li>
      <li>Focused on <abbr
        title="SOLID is an acronym for five main principles of Object-Oriented Programming: single responsibility principle, open-closed principle, Liskov substitution principle, interface segregation principle and dependency inversion principle">SOLID</abbr>,
        <abbr
          title="Understood as structured in such a way, that it can be easily tested in a maximum possible isolation from the whole system.">testable</abbr>,
        <abbr
          title="Understood as encapsulating and isolating complexity in a clearly defined and small enough context so it can be reasoned and side effects of change can be easily predicted.">maintainable</abbr>
        code, and developer experience
      </li>
      <li>I've put most of my learning in to testing and managing complexity. Languages, libraries and frameworks come and go</li>
      <li>Not a DevOps, but I was setting up and maintaining CI pipelines for <abbr
        title="small to medium-sized business">SMB</abbr>, and used
        Docker, Terraform, Ansible, GitHub, GitLab, etc. to keep infrastructure in <abbr title="version control system">VCS</abbr>.
        Worked with Azure, DigitalOcean, and AWS
      </li>
      <li>Not a database geek, but on friendly terms with PostgreSQL - I can act on <code>EXPLAIN ANALYZE</code> results
        or switch to another dialect with some help from the documentation. Still waiting for a good excuse to use a
        NoSQL database instead
      </li>
      <li>Happy to create a frontend as part of work on a full stack project or to set up its foundations for other
        developers to use - as I did many times before, but not interested in doing frontend full-time
      </li>
      <li>
        I'm experimenting with "AI" coding tools, but I'm still highly skeptical. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.06952">They have fundamental limitations</a> as a form of machine learning, and while they can supercharge experienced engineers, they cannot be trusted blindly.
      </li>
      <li>Haven’t trained for white-board algorithmic challenges. The best way of assessing my value for a potential
        employer is a recruitment task or an interview with a developer of similar or greater experience</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Who am I as a person</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>I have strong opinions but loosely held & I'm aware that every decision will be a trade-off</li>
      <li>Vast, although often shallow, knowledge of current trends, technologies, and tools used in the backend,
        frontend, and operations. I prefer keeping mental bookmarks and evaluating tools when a need arises instead of
        chasing hype
      </li>
      <li>Research skills and curiosity allow for fast adaptation to new methodologies, tools, and technologies, but I
        have no expert-level knowledge in any particular field. I learn when the need arises
      </li>
      <li>I tend to focus on high-level concepts, not things I can, and I do search for all the
        time.
      </li>
      <li>No management ambitions, although I value independence and ownership. I assumed the role of informal <strong>tech</strong>
        lead a few times if it was required to move the project forward, but I love to solve problems not to manage people
      </li>
      <li>Used to and fond of working in international, diverse teams and English-only communication - both verbally and
        in writing
      </li>
      <li>Privately, I love good reportage or sci-fi from 80s, vintage cocktail bars, and switching from one nerdy obsession to
        another. Lately I added gym to the mix. Solving hard problems and lifting heavy have some things in common.
      </li>

      <p>I've migrated the whole system from "ball-of-mud" to event-driven architecture, to cover critical paths with

      <p>Microservices-light where in place—understood as independent, minimal Django sub-applications
        communicating via REST endpoints or events brokered by Kafka. Deployed together on a single server, but ready to
        be extracted and scaled independently at a moment's notice. React SPA on the front feed by our
        GraphQL API. All well-tested.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It took me two weeks to learn Python/Django enough to contribute fully tested production code, and two
          months to be able to contribute meaningful improvements to our whole code-base
        </li>
        <li>Moved legacy PHP supporting systems and almost 3-years worth of data to our main infrastructure</li>
        <li>As a team, we built a customer journey that provided both great UX and gathered every possible
          bit of data that could help our sales, which we feed to our CRM and marketing automation

      </ul>
      <p>The company dissolved after a third unsuccessful pivot when it became obvious that parts of our sales
        pipeline cannot be automated. Therefore, additional staff required will prevent us from scaling as efficiently
        as investors expected.</p>

      <p>Starting architecture could be described as "the less you know, the better you sleep", migrated to "it's ugly,
        but it can be understood, works and is stable", and further to "let's extract things that shouldn't be here in
        the first place to separate Symfony-based projects" - It was a set of ugly compromises enforced by legacy and
        vendors, but gave the company time we needed to look for more stable solution.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Migrated the company from FTP deployment and SVN to Git, and on-premises GitLab for the deployment process

        <li>Increased template and code reuse by orders of magnitude</li>
        <li>Replaced an assorted collection of PHP 5.2.17 (version enforced by vendor) scripts augmenting our
          legacy CMS, by self-built Symfony-inspired light framework enabling us to introduce automated testing and
          creation of Vagrant-based local environments for developers
        </li>
        <li>Introduced automated testing</li>
        <li>Introduced proper logging solution</li>
        <li>Fixed a multitude of errors falsifying our analytics data</li>
        <li>Replaced template-embedded frontend scripts with a proper build process and React-based components</li>
        <li>Improved uptime/availability of our main property from around 97.6% to 99.4%</li>
        <li>Improved loading times for our customers and their consistency by order of magnitude</li>
        <li>Lead a focused effort to improve the SEO of our properties</li>
        <li>Added to search engines indexes millions of missing pieces of content—lost after previous CMS migration</li>
        <li>Reworked our advertising system to allow new ad formats and better experience for our customers</li>
        <li>The whole process improved our traffic and Unique Users numbers by around one third</li>

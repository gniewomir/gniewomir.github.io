    <h1>Who am I as a professional</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Well-known stacks:
        <ul>
          <li>TypeScript with Node/NestJS/Express/React/Redux/GraphQL/REST etc. and supporting toolchain</li>
          <li>PHP with Symfony/Laravel/WordPress and vanilla flavor</li>
          <li><abbr
            title="I haven't used this stack in day-to-day work for a long time, therefore I will need an additional month or so to become fully productive.">Rusty</abbr>
            Python with Django/DRF
          </li>
          <li>I'm open to learning other technologies
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>In most of my past projects, the biggest challenge was extracting business rules from legacy or expressing and enforcing them in a testable, clear way. That defined where I've put most of my learning - testing and managing complexity</li>
      <li>I strongly believe that <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.04374.pdf" title="Code Red: The Business Impact of Code Quality – A Quantitative Study of 39 Proprietary Production Codebases">development speed is a function of quality</a> in any non-trivial code-base</li>
      <li>I consider automated tests a requirement. A <abbr title="Understood as using domain terms in 'arrange' and 'assert' steps in a way, that allows even non-developers to understand the initial and expected state of the system. If we do have to resort to explicit mocking in a test, then we will increase the costs while receiving only partial benefits of proper testing">human-readable</abbr> self-validating specification of behavior</li>
      <li>I consider static code analysis and code standard enforcement tools as a must</li>
      <li>Focused on <abbr
        title="SOLID is an acronym for five main principles of Object-Oriented Programming: single responsibility principle, open-closed principle, Liskov substitution principle, interface segregation principle and dependency inversion principle">SOLID</abbr>,
        <abbr
          title="Understood as structured in such a way, that it can be easily tested in a maximum possible isolation from the whole system.">testable</abbr>,
        <abbr
          title="Understood as encapsulating and isolating complexity in a clearly defined and small enough context so it can be reasoned and side effects of change can be easily predicted.">maintainable</abbr>
        code, and developer experience
      </li>
      <li>Not a DevOps, but I was setting up and maintaining CI pipelines for <abbr
        title="small to medium-sized business">SMB</abbr>, and used
        Docker, Terraform, Ansible, GitHub, GitLab, etc. to keep infrastructure in <abbr title="version control system">VCS</abbr>.
        Worked with Azure, DigitalOcean, and AWS
      </li>
      <li>Not a database geek, but on friendly terms with PostgreSQL - I can act on <code>EXPLAIN ANALYZE</code> results
        or switch to another dialect with some help from the documentation. Still waiting for a good excuse to use a
        NoSQL database instead
      </li>
      <li>Happy to create a frontend as part of work on a full stack project or to set up its foundations for other
        developers to use - as I did many times before, but not interested in doing frontend full-time
      </li>
      <li>
        I'm experimenting with "AI" coding tools, but I'm still skeptical. They are a good way to scaffold if prompted correctly or as smart autocomplete, but require constant vigilance. Both when used as knowledge engine and in agentic mode.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Who am I as a person</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>I have strong opinions but loosely held. I'm aware that every decision will be a trade-off</li>
      <li>Vast, although often shallow, knowledge of current trends, technologies, and tools used in the backend,
        frontend, and operations. I prefer keeping mental bookmarks and evaluating tools when a need arises instead of
        chasing hype
      </li>
      <li>Research skills and curiosity allow for fast adaptation to new methodologies, tools, and technologies, but I
        have no expert-level knowledge in any particular field. A consequence of being a full stack with a background in
        fast-paced Internet media
      </li>
      <li>No management ambitions, although I value independence and ownership. I assumed the role of informal <strong>tech</strong>
        lead a few times if it was required to move the project forward, but this is as far as I'm willing to go at the
        moment
      </li>
      <li>I tend to focus on high-level concepts, not things I can, and I do search for all the
        time. Haven’t trained for white-board algorithmic challenges. The best way of assessing my value for a potential
        employer is a recruitment task or an interview with a developer of similar or greater experience
      </li>
      <li>Used to and fond of working in international, diverse teams and English-only communication - both verbally and
        in writing
      </li>
      <li>Privately, I love good reportage or sci-fi from 80s, vintage cocktail bars, and switching from one nerdy obsession to
        another. Lately I added gym to the mix. Solving hard problems and lifting heavy have some things in common.
      </li>

      <p>Starting architecture could be described as "the less you know, the better you sleep", migrated to "it's ugly,
        but it can be understood, works and is stable", and further to "let's extract things that shouldn't be here in
        the first place to separate Symfony-based projects" - It was a set of ugly compromises enforced by legacy and
        vendors. But hey, it worked and was stable after just a few months of work which was a great improvement from
        the business standpoint.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Migrated the company from FTP deployment and SVN to Git, and on-premises GitLab for the deployment process

        <li>Replaced an assorted collection of PHP 5.2.17 (version enforced by vendor) scripts augmenting our

        <li>Replaced template-embedded frontend scripts with a proper build process and React-based components</li>
        <li>Improved uptime/availability of our main property from around 97.6% to 99.4%</li>
        <li>Improved loading times for our customers and their consistency by order of magnitude</li>
        <li>Lead a focused effort to improve the SEO of our properties</li>
        <li>Added to search engines indexes millions of missing pieces of content—lost after previous CMS migration</li>
        <li>Reworked our advertising system to allow new ad formats and better experience for our customers</li>
        <li>The whole process improved our traffic and Unique Users numbers by around one third</li>

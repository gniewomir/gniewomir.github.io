    <h1>Who am I as a professional</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>I believe that <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.04374.pdf" title="Code Red: The Business Impact of Code Quality – A Quantitative Study of 39 Proprietary Production Codebases">development speed is a
        function of quality</a> in any non-trivial code-base
      </li>
      <li>I consider automated tests the best form of documentation</li>
      <li>I consider static code analysis and code standard enforcement tools as a must</li>
      <li>Focused on <abbr title="SOLID is an acronym for five main principles of Object-Oriented Programming: single responsibility principle, open-closed principle, Liskov substitution principle, interface segregation principle and dependency inversion principle">SOLID</abbr>,
        <abbr title="Understood as structured in such a way, that it can be easily tested in a maximum possible isolation from the whole system.">testable</abbr>,
        <abbr title="Understood as encapsulating and isolating complexity in a clearly defined and small enough context so it can be reasoned and side effects of change can be easily predicted.">maintainable</abbr>
        code, and developer experience
      </li>
      <li>I'm deeply aware that every decision in our line of work is a trade-off</li>
      <li>I've put most of my learning into testing and managing
        complexity. Languages, frameworks &amp; libs come and go
      </li>
      <li>
        Familiar with "AI" tools like Cursor &amp; models powering them. While LLMs still <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.06952">have fundamental
        limitations</a> as a form of machine learning, in practice they can supercharge experienced engineers - as long as a human is still at the steering wheel.
      </li>
      <li>Not a DevOps, but I was setting up and maintaining CI pipelines
        for <abbr title="small to medium-sized business">SMB</abbr>, and
        used
        Docker, Terraform, Ansible, GitHub, GitLab, etc. to keep infrastructure in <abbr title="version control system">VCS</abbr>.
        Worked with Azure, DigitalOcean, and AWS
      </li>
      <li>Not a database geek, but on friendly terms with PostgreSQL - I
        can act on <code>EXPLAIN ANALYZE</code> results
        or switch to another dialect with some help from the documentation. Waiting for a good reason to use a
        NoSQL database instead
      </li>
      <li>Happy to create a frontend as part of work on a full stack
        project or to set up its foundations for other
        developers to use - as I did many times before, but I don't consider myself a Frontend developer.
      </li>
      <li>Haven’t trained for white-board algorithmic challenges. The
        best way of assessing my value for a potential
        employer is a recruitment task or an interview with a developer of similar or greater experience
      </li>
      <li>Worked mostly in agile teams, using different interpretations of Scrum with mandatory code reviews</li>
      <li>Used to and fond of working in international, diverse teams and
        English-only communication
      </li>

    <h1>Who am I as a person</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>I believe in Paul Saffo <a href="https://halfbanana.medium.com/strong-opinions-weakly-held-a-paradox-unpacked-6201fffe797e">"Strong Opinions, Weakly Held."</a> mental framework</li>
      <li>I assumed the role of informal <strong>tech</strong>
        lead a few times, when it was required to move the project forward, but I love to solve problems—not to manage
        people
      </li>
      <li>Extensive, although often shallow, knowledge of current trends,
        technologies, and tools used in the backend,
        frontend, and operations. I keep mental bookmarks and evaluate tools when a need arises
      </li>
      <li>I have research skills and curiosity and adapt fast to new methodologies, tools, and technologies.</li>
      <li>I love good reportage or sci-fi from the 80s, vintage cocktail bars, and switching from one nerdy obsession to
        another.</li>
      <li>I lift heavy. Gym is the best stress management tool I've ever tried.</li>

        <li>Led a large data migration project aimed at filling the gaps in our lead data in Salesforce, involving fuzzy matching of data from different sources without common keys.

        <li>Planned and documented redesign of Underwriting Domain to increase the visibility of our decision-making process and speed up the process of introducing new products and markets.

      <h3>Business impact</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Added millions of missing pieces of
          content—lost after previous CMS migration—back to search engines' index
        </li>
        <li>Removed discrepancies in our analytics falsifying traffic reports</li>
        <li>Improved uptime/availability of our main property from around
          97.6% to 99.4%
        </li>
        <li>Improved loading times for our customers and their
          consistency by an order of magnitude
        </li>
        <li>Reworked our advertising system to allow new ad formats and
          better experience for our customers
        </li>
        <li>The whole process improved our traffic and unique users
          numbers by around one third
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Technical impact</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Migrated the company from FTP deployment and SVN to Git and
          on-premises GitLab for the deployment process
        </li>
        <li>Banned FTP access to production. I built and maintained
          GIT&lt;-&gt;SVN bridge for the transition period</li>
        <li>Understood, fixed our implementation and documented a badly
          misused and misunderstood caching system
        </li>
        <li>Introduced automated testing and proper telemetry</li>
        <li>Increased template and code reuse by orders of magnitude</li>
        <li>Replaced an assorted collection of PHP 5.2.17 (version
          enforced by vendor) scripts augmenting our
          legacy CMS, by self-built Symfony-inspired light framework enabling us to introduce automated testing and
          creation of Vagrant-based local environments for developers
        </li>
        <li>Replaced template-embedded frontend scripts with a proper
          build process and React-based components
